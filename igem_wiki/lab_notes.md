### Week 10.06 - 16.06

#### Dry lab
- Prepared "Ultra Competent" *E.coli* Cells [Protocol](https://github.com/intbio/2019_igem/blob/master/protocols/bio-protocol143.pdf)
- Transformed *E.coli* competent cells with [PET28a GFP](https://benchling.com/s/seq-S3tBcQb1ENmPLygZHF46) plasmid and [BBa_K1150000](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1150000) (dCas9) [Protocol](https://github.com/intbio/2019_igem/blob/master/protocols/bio-protocol143.pdf)

#### Wet lab
- Conducted a literature search: 
   * found PAM sequences of Cas9 proteins for three organisms: *Streptococcus pyogenes*, *Staphylococcus aureus*, *Campylobacter jejuni*
   * made a list of tick-borne diseases
   * chose the most dangerous species (in Russia) from *Ixodes* family
   * made a list of organisms (pathogen and nonpathogen) associated with *Ixodes ricinus* 
  
 - Created a model of two SpCas9 proteins in Chimera to determine number of bases between two dCas9 proteins 

### Week 17.06 - 23.06

#### Dry lab
- Extracted [PET28a GFP](https://benchling.com/s/seq-S3tBcQb1ENmPLygZHF46) plasmid and [BBa_K1150000](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1150000) plasmid DNA from 20 ml of *E.coli* culture [Kit instructions]()
- PCR with VR and VF2 primers ([BBa_K1150000](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1150000) biobrick verification)

#### Wet lab
- Conduct the analysis of *B.burgdorferi* genome
   * made a list of suitable PAM sequences
   * made a list of markers for *B.burgdorferi* detection
 
 ### Week 1.07 - 7.07
 
 #### Dry lab
 - Sent for sequencing [BBa_K1150000](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1150000)
 - Received sequencing results for [BBa_K1150000](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1150000)
   * Alignment with sequence from iGEM Parts Registry showed that sequence is inconsistent
 
 ### Week 8.07 - 14.07
 
 #### Dry lab
 
 
 ### Week 12.08 - 18.08
 
 #### Dry lab
 - Received bacterial expression plasmid for Sp-dCas9 & sgRNA [MSP712](https://www.addgene.org/65768/)
 - Extracted MSP712 plasmid DNA from 100 ml of *E.coli* culture [Kit instructions]()
 - Conducted a restriction analysis of MSP712 plasmid
   * Gel electrophoresis result did not match with our virtual digest result. A possible explanation is that there was a mistake in plasmid annotation. We decided not to use MSP712 plasmid for our experiments.
 
 ### Week 19.08 - 25.08
 
 #### Dry lab
 - Received bacterial expression plasmid for Sp-dCas9
