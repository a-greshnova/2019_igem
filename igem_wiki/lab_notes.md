### Week 10.06 - 16.06

#### Dry lab
- Preparation of "Ultra Competent" *E.coli* Cells [Protocol](https://github.com/intbio/2019_igem/blob/master/protocols/bio-protocol143.pdf)
- Transformation of *E.coli* with [PET28a GFP](https://benchling.com/s/seq-S3tBcQb1ENmPLygZHF46) plasmid and [BBa_K1150000](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1150000) (dCas9) [Protocol](https://github.com/intbio/2019_igem/blob/master/protocols/bio-protocol143.pdf)

#### Wet lab
- Literature search: 
 * PAM sequences of Cas9 proteins from different organisms
